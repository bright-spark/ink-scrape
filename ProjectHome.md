Want to get data from a web page but don't want to spend time analysing its DOM tree? Use this tool to quickly build the brain for your spider.

Unlike a tree-based scrapers, this is a **search-based scraper**, meaning that data is gleaned by matching its surrounding data against the data you provide.

You can provide the surrounding data that **incrementally** adds to specificity and accuracy -- the more the surrounding data, the greater the confidence that you've found the data you want.

Scraping built on this principle is very very tightly dependent on the site structure. The more specific the surrounding data, the more likely your spider is to breakÔºÅUse it if you think the cost of building a nimble, adaptable spider is not worth the time.
